# **Wireframe?**
#### practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
# focuses on how the designer wants the user to process information on a site.
# is a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.
# lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface

### **What to consider when deciding on your wireframing proces**

# *task of wireframing in different ways. Some like to draw by hand, while others like to use apps or tools found online*
###### *number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:*

* Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
* Sketch > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

## **The best tools for wireframing**

## **How to make your wireframe in six steps**
* Do your research
* Prepare your research for quick reference
* Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
* Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
* Add some detail and get testing
* Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

## **HTML basics**
* Hypertext Markup Language
* the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
* markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements
* enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else
* The main parts of our element are as follows:

# 1 The opening tag
# 2 The closing tag
# 3 The content
# 4 The element


### attribute should always have the following:

* A space between it and the element name 
* The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
* The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks
# **Semantics** 
# refers to the meaning of a piece of code —
### In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. 
### In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits.
### In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page
#### This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.
## **benefits from writing semantic markup are :**
* Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
* Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
