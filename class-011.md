## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment 

## Give a real world example.
Ex:MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL


## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
its better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

## Give a real world example.

All big company like amazon have a huge database used to store all data.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

The NoSql is best fit for hierarchial data 

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

# NOSQL vs SQL 

## What does SQL stand for?

stands for Structured Query Language.

## What is a realational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

it support the sq language works with tabels

## What is a ‘schema’?

strict requirement for data we store which decide the data can go into a table

## What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.


## How does NoSQL  work?

it consist of collection insted of tabels and inside of it there is documents which are rows in the tabel we can say and it's look like json files.

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

Mongo does't  have to use the same schema and you can have multiple documents in one collection which have diffrent fields and there is no relations between documents

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB Becuse of:
* less schema
* few relations
* data nested in few collections
