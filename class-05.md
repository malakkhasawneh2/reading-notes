# Adding Images
* < img >
  - To add an image into the page
  - It must carry the following two attributes:
    - src
      - This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.
    - alt
      - This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it. 
    - title
      - provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.
