# **JavaScript**
##  a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions 
* it's scripting language for Web pages.
* many non-browser environments also can use it.
* JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative 
 *  The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). 
* The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. 

# **Java Script first steps**
#### Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.
# **JavaScript building blocks**
Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features
* types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.
# **Introducing JavaScript objects**
* The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you.
# **Asynchronous JavaScript**
* Discusses asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server.
# **JavaScript guide**
* A much more detailed guide to the JavaScript language, aimed at those with previous programming experience either in JavaScript or another language.
# **Intermediate**
* Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks

# **JavaScript data structures**
* Overview of available data structures in JavaScript.
# **Equality comparisons and sameness**
* JavaScript provides three different value-comparison operations: strict equality using ===, loose equality using ==, and the Object.is() method.

# **Creating HTML is cumbersome**
* Even in such a simple HTML we wanted to create we had to use + several time and the code is quite unreadable. 

 * Basically a template would be an HTML snippet with some place holders and then a function call that gets the HTML snippet (the template) as a parameter, and gets several key-value pairs. The function then returns a new HTML snippet in which the place holders were replaced by the value of the appropriate key.
