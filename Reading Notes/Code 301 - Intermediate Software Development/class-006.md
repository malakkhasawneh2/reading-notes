## How does pair programming work?
pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver who is typing .

The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code

### *** How does pair programming work? ***

- It's work by two programmers working together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes the code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of the code as it is written. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
