## ***Pain and Suffering***
 All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing, as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that, this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life.
 Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

# Big O notation 
is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

- O(1)

an algorithm that will always execute in the same time regardless of the size of the input data set.

- O(N)

an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

- O(N<sup>2</sup>)

an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

- O(2^N)

an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

- O(log N)

described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase
