# How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn

## What is Scikit-learn
    Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning.
    It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

## Exploring Boston Housing Data Set
    The first step is to import the required Python libraries into Ipython Notebook.
        from sklearn.datasets import load-boston
        boston = load_boston()

## Set the X and Y axes
    Y = boston housing price(also called “target” data in Python)
    X = all the other features (or independent variables)


## Fitting the model
    lm.fit() -> fits a linear model

## Predicting Prices
    lm.predict()
