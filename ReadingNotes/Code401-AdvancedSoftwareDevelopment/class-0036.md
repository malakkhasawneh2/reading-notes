## The Advice: Communicate!

The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.


### What Do You Mean Communicate?
* First, Restate the Question
* Ask About Edge Cases
* Ask About Test Cases
* Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
* Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
* Stuck? Ask for Help!




## 7 tips to ace a programming interview

### Take a few minutes.
Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.
Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions, and then tell your interviewer:
“Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”


### Write down the steps of the solution.
Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way.

### Write pseudocode first.
Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode. Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.


### Don’t sweat the small stuff.
Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.


### Sit down. Be humble.
A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. 

### Come prepared.
When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat). If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.

### Review your work.
You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution. If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”. Interviews are stressful and we want them to be over as fast as possible. This is reasonable, but:
Think about how silly you look if your solution is not right.
Instead, if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.
