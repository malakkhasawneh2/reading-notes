# ***Dunder Methods***

### What Are Dunder Methods?
In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example init or str.

Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesn’t support this behavior out of the box:

```
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
42
```

### Special Methods and the Python Data Model
This elegant design is known as the Python data model and lets developers tap into rich language features like sequences, iteration, operator overloading, attribute access, etc.



### Object Initialization: __init__

To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder:

```
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []
```

### Object Representation: __str__, __repr__

1. __repr__: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.

2. __str__: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.


```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
            self.owner, self.amount)
```



# ***Basic Statistics in Python — Probability***

## What is probability?

At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss. 

## From statistics to probability
Our data will be generated by flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many times we get heads. We will call a set of 10 coin tosses a trial. Our data point will be the number of heads we observe. We may not get the “ideal” 5 heads, but we won’t worry too much since one trial is only one data point. If we perform many, many trials, we expect the average number of heads over all of our trials to approach the 50%. The code below simulates 10, 100, 1000, and 1000000 trials, and then calculates the average proportion of heads observed. 

## The data and the distribution
Before we can tackle the question of “which wine is better than average,” we have to mind the nature of our data. Intuitively, we’d like to use the scores of the wines to compare groups, but there comes a problem: the scores usually fall in a range. 

The most important qualities to notice about the normal distribution is its symmetry and its shape. We’ve been calling it a distribution, but what exactly is being distributed? It depends on the context. In probability, the normal distribution is a particular distribution of the probability across all of the events. The x-axis takes on the values of events we want to know the probability of. The y-axis is the probability associated with each event, from 0 to 1.
