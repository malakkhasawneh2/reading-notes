# **What is CSS for?**
* **CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.**

* **A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language**

* **Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience.**
* **used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links.**
* **It can be used to create layout** 
# **CSS syntax**
* CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. 
* For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."

* The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:

#  h1 {
   # color: red;
  # font-size: 5em;
# } 
* A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.

# h1 {
  #  color: red;
  # font-size: 5em;
# }

# p {
# color: black;
# }
# **How To Add CSS?**
# There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS
# _External CSS_
* With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

* Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
# _Internal CSS_
* An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

* The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.
# _Inline CSS_
* An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

* To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
